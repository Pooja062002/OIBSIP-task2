          <h3>Some of the Motivational Quotes by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
                “Dream, Dream, Dream.
                Dreams transform into thoughts
                and thoughts result in action.”
                
            </li>
            <li>
                “Be active! Take on responsibility! Work for the things you believe in. If you do not, you are surrendering your fate to others.”
            </li>
            <li>
                “If you fail, never give up because F.A.I.L. means 'First Attempt In Learning'. End is not the end; in fact E.N.D. means 'Effort Never Dies'. If you get No as an answer, remember N.O. means 'Next Opportunity'. So Let's be positive.”
            </li>
            <li>
                “Dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep.”
            </li>
           
            <li>
                “Don't fear for facing failure in the first attempt, because even the successful Maths starts with 'Zero' only.”
            </li>
           
          </ul>
